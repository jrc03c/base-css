  <p>
    In the myriadic year of our Lord — the ten thousandth year of the King
    Undying, the kindly Prince of Death! — Gideon Nav packed her sword, her
    shoes, and her dirty magazines, and she escaped from the House of the Ninth.
  </p>

  <p>
    She didn't run. Gideon never ran unless she had to. In the absolute darkness
    before dawn she brushed her teeth without concern and splashed her face with
    water, and even went so far as to sweep the dust off the floor of her cell.
    She shook out her big black church robe and hung it from the hook. Having
    done this every day for over a decade, she no longer needed light to do it
    by. This late in the equinox no light would make it here for months, in any
    case; you could tell the season by how hard the heating vents were creaking.
    She dressed herself from head to toe in polymer and synthetic weave. She
    combed her hair. Then Gideon whistled through her teeth as she unlocked her
    security cuff, and arranged it and its stolen key considerately on her
    pillow, like a chocolate in a fancy hotel.

    Leaving her cell and swinging her pack over one shoulder, she took the time
    to walk down five flights to her mother's nameless catacomb niche. This was
    pure sentiment, as her mother hadn't been there since Gideon was little and
    would never go back in it now. Then came the long hike up twenty-two flights
    the back way, not one light relieving the greasy dark, heading to the
    splitoff shaft and the pit where her ride would arrive: the shuttle was due
    in two hours.
